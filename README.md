“Road Racer” is a basic 2D arcade game where the player(racer) tries to avoid the incoming cars
and get as many coins. 

The Game’s premise: the game consists of a car which appears near the bottom of the gameplay
screen with a background image of a Highway. The user can move the car to the left and right using
the corresponding arrow keys. A series of coins and incoming cars fall from the top of the screen.
Each coin will fall from a different x position, with different speeds between 3 and 6 pixels per frame 
straight down, while for the cars(obstacle) moves with a different speed between 6 and 12 pixels 
per frame straight down.If the car(player) touches a coin, a positive sound effect is played, while if 
the car(player) collides with the incoming car(obstacle), a crash sound effect is played. If a coin or
car(obstacle) leaves the bottom of the screen, it is reset to a new random position at the top of the
Screen with a new falling speed.
